A comprehensive skill for building production-ready **Astro 5.x** applications with Islands Architecture, client directives, and modern web patterns.

> **🚀 Astro 5 Ready**: Updated with all Astro 5 breaking changes including the new Content Collections loader API, ClientRouter (formerly ViewTransitions), and context.locals updates.
>
> **AI-Powered Development**: This skill enhances AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) with expert Astro patterns and best practices.

## What This Skill Covers

- **Islands Architecture**: Zero JavaScript by default with selective hydration
- **Client Directives**: `client:load`, `client:idle`, `client:visible`, `client:media`, `client:only`
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Mix React, Vue, and Svelte in the same project
- **Content Collections**: Type-safe CMS with new loader API (`glob()`, `file()`) - Astro 5
- **View Transitions**: SPA-like navigation with `<ClientRouter />` - Astro 5
- **Advanced Patterns**: SSR, middleware, image optimization, API endpoints
- **Real-World Examples**: Blogs, forms, authentication, i18n, SEO, dark mode

import Header from '../components/Header.astro';
import Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';
---

<html>
  <body>
    <!-- Static HTML (no JS) -->
    <Header />
    
    <!-- Only hydrate when needed -->
    <Counter client:idle />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Why Astro?
